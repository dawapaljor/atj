        <p class="text-2xl italic font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">"In a true and ideal democratic system, freedom of speech is recognised as an important element. For that, independent media is essential as media plays vital role in people’s daily lives.

            Therefore, our media should always try to enlighten and educate the general public, by covering world affairs as well as providing general information – particularly news related to Tibet.
            
            This social responsibility should be implemented in the most dedicated manner, and consistently for as long as the need exists.
            
            The formation of a press club is a very welcome measure in order to improve and better organise the Tibetan media. I offer my prayers for the growth of an exemplary Association of Tibetan Journalists."</p>
