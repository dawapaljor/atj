                           In 1997, the Tibetan journalists working in Dharamsala met to form an organisation. The outcome was the immediate initiation of the Association of Tibetan Journalists. Subsequently, a formal Charter was adopted and the association commenced to function, even with the meagre resources available at that time.

                       At the completion of Pema Dhondupâ€™s tenure, Rabsel took over the post of President. He served until the current President, Lobsang Wangyal, commenced his tenure on 12 May 2002.
