##  Our History

In 1997, the Tibetan journalists working in Dharamsala met to form an organisation. The outcome was the immediate initiation of the Association of Tibetan Journalists. Subsequently, a formal Charter was adopted and the association commenced to function, even with the meagre resources available at that time.

Pema Dhondup, the former Producer and Editor of Sargyur, a periodical video news magazine, was elected the first President of the associaton. Rabsel, the former Editor of Tibet Times, a Tibetan language newspaper published three times a month, was elected as Vice President.

At the completion of Pema Dhondupâ€™s tenure, Rabsel took over the post of President. He served until the current President, Lobsang Wangyal, commenced his tenure on 12 May 2002.

Ugyen Norbu, a former reporter of Radio Free Asia, served as the General Secretary since the inception of the association, until his resignation at the end of July 2004 to pursue further studies in the US.

*   Pema Dhondup, former Producer and Editor of Sargyur
