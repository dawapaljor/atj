### Second Resolution

At the second convention of the Club, the journalists passed the following resolution.

We, the delegates gathered at the second conference of the Tibetan Independent journalists in Dharamsala, have noted that:

1.  1\. The Chinese authorities have claimed earth-shaking developments inside Tibet and spread the word around the world that Tibetans inside Tibet are living a happy life;

3.  2\. The Chinese authorities have invited journalists from Taiwan, Thailand, India and Nepal to cover the situation inside Tibet;

5.  3\. The Chinese authorities have not invited journalists from Tibetans in Diaspora to cover their homeland;

and, therefore, we call on the Chinese authorities to invite a delegation of Tibetan Independent journalists based in Dharamsala to cover the real situation in Tibet as soon as possible for fair assessment of the situation.
