Code of Ethics
--------------

The principles of Tibetan media are designed to promote professional journalistic ethics. They are building on the members and non-adherence could lead to cancellation of their membership.

Complaints of non-adherence can be made to the Governing body by any member of the community in writing and the Governing body shall then meet to discuss the complaint in light of argument put forward by both the parties involved. If a member does not respond to a notice issued by the board within the time limit set then the offence shall be assumed and besides the membership standing cancelled, all other necessary action as considered necessary shall be taken.

**1.** Respect for the truth and accurate informing of the public are the overriding principles of the press.

**2.** News and information accepted for text or pictorial publication must be checked for accuracy with all the thoroughness circumstances permit. Its meaning must not be distorted or falsified by editing, headings or captions. The content of documents must be faithfully reproduced. Unconfirmed reports, rumours and assumptions must be identified as unconfirmed reports, rumours and assumptions

**3.**Published news reports or assertions subsequently found to be incorrect must be promptly and appropriately corrected by the publication concerned.

**4.** Dishonest methods must not be employed in acquiring news, information or pictures.

**5.** As a general principle, confidentiality agreed at briefings and background interviews must be observed.

**6.** All members of the Tibetan press shall maintain professional confidentiality, exercise their right to refuse to give evidence and refrain from disclosing the identity of informants without their explicit consent.

**7.** The responsibility of the press towards the general public includes the publication of editorial matter, which is influenced by the private or business interests of third parties. Publishers and editors must resist any attempts at such influence and ensure that editorial and advertising matter are kept clearly separate. Paid advertisement, advertising photographs and advertising drawings should be identifiable as such.

**8.** The press shall respect the private life and personal sphere of the individual. If a person’s private behaviour touches on public interests, however, it may be discussed in the press. In such cases, care must be taken to ensure that publication does not violate the personal rights of individuals who are not involved.

**9.** It is contrary to journalistic decorum to publish unfounded allegations, especially allegations of a defamatory nature.

**10.** The publication of text or pictures whose form or content could deeply offend the moral or religious sensibilities of a particular group of persons is incompatible with press responsibility.

11\. There must be no discrimination against anyone on grounds of sex, race, ethnic background, religion, social group, or nationality.

**12.** The acceptance or granting of any kind of privilege which could impinge on publishing or editorial discretion is not compatible with the concept of a respectable, independent and responsible press. Anyone accepting bribes for the dissemination or suppression of news is guilty of dishonourable and unprofessional conduct.

**13.** Election campaign reporting : In the interests of journalistic fairness, freedom of information for the public and equality of opportunity for the parties and candidates, newspapers and magazines covering election campaigns should also publish views which they do not share themselves.

14\. Press releases : Press releases issued by government agencies, and organisations or other representative’s bodies must be identified as such if they are published unedited.

**15.** Interviews : An interview is always within the bounds of journalistic propriety if it is authorized by the interviewee. An interview given orally or in written form is not mere news material but a work protected by copyright, especially if it contains critical appraisals or comments which lend it a personal stamp. Where such interviews are reproduced in full or in part, the publishing newspaper or magazine must indicate the source. Even where the essence of the thoughts expressed is paraphrased, journalistic propriety requires that the source should be indicated.

**16.** Reader’s letters: Periodicals should publish reader’s letters to give readers an opportunity to air their views and help form public opinion. In this way, a newspaper can promote discussion of its own editorial line, stimulate public debate and foster personal initiative
